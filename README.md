Project Description:

ToDo-app is a web application that was developed based on the React framework, which allows users to create, edit and mark completed tasks.
Developing this application I used functional component, hooks, forms, requests to REST API.

Using React technologies, the application provides fast and continuous interaction with the user. The interface of the application is simple and intuitive, which allows even new users to quickly master its functionality.

The main functionality of the application is to create lists of tasks. A user can add new tasks, edit existing ones, and mark tasks that have already been completed, which helps him visually track progress and achievements.
